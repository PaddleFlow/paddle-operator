# Paddle Operator

## Overview

Paddle Operator makes it easy to run [paddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/)
distributed training job on kubernetes by providing PaddleJob custom resource etc.

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites

* Kubernetes >= 1.8
* kubectl

### Installation

With kubernetes ready, you can install paddle operator with configuration in *deploy* folder 
(use *deploy/v1* for kubernetes v1.16+ or *deploy/v1beta1* for kubernetes 1.15-).

Create PaddleJob crd,
```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator/main/deploy/v1/crd.yaml
```

A succeed creation leads to result as follows,
```shell
$ kubectl get crd
NAME                                    CREATED AT
paddlejobs.batch.paddlepaddle.org       2021-02-08T07:43:24Z
```

Then deploy controller,

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator/main/deploy/v1/operator.yaml
```

the ready state of controller would be as follow,
```shell
$ kubectl -n paddle-system get pods
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
paddle-controller-manager-698dd7b855-n65jr   1/1     Running   0          1m
```

By default, paddle controller runs in namespace *paddle-system* and only controll jobs in that namespace.
To run controller in a different namespace or controll jobs in other namespaces, you can edit `charts/paddle-operator/values.yaml` and install the helm chart.
You can also edit kustomization files or edit `deploy/v1/operator.yaml` directly for that purpose.

### Run demo paddlejob

Deploy your first paddlejob demo with
```shell
$ kubectl -n paddle-system apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator/main/deploy/examples/wide_and_deep.yaml
```

Check pods status
```shell
$ kubectl -n paddle-system get pods
```

Check paddle job status
```shell
$ kubectl -n paddle-system get pdj
```

### Uninstall

Simply
```shell
$ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator/main/deploy/v1/crd.yaml -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator/main/deploy/v1/operator.yaml
```
